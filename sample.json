When you are having pain in your lungs, and back pain, they may or may not be related. Learning the signs of lung cancer, the causes of lung disease, and understanding the causes of back pain will help you to find out if the pain in your lungs and the pain in your back are associated. There are also many possible causes of lung or breathing pain, which are not associated with your back or spine. Among these would be a collapsed lung, or an infection of some type, such as pneumonia or an abscess. You may also have pleuritis or pleurisy, an inflammation of the pleura that covers the lungs.", "passage_ID": 53}, {"is_selected": 0, "url": "http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hhw/anatomy", "passage_text": "Your heart is located under your ribcage in the center of your chest between your right and left lungs. Its muscular walls beat, or contract, pumping blood to all parts of your body. The size of your heart can vary depending on your age, size, and the condition of your heart. Oxygen-rich blood from your lungs passes through the pulmonary veins (shown in red to the right of the left atrium in figure B above). The blood enters the left atrium and is pumped into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the rest of your body through the aorta.", "passage_ID": 54}], "query_id": 19704, "answers": ["Inside the rib cage."], "query_type": "location", "query": "where are the lungs located in the back"}]
